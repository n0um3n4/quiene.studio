## High-level concept

**Working title:**

**Genre:**
Narrative-driven life sim / adventure with branching story, light resource management (time, energy, mental health).

**Core fantasy:**
You live the same kind of day over and over in Tokyo as a burned-out guy in his late 30s, but slowly discover that:

1. You *are* paying off karmic debt from a brutal past life.
2. You can choose *how* you suffer: resentful, numb, or conscious and compassionate.
3. Your small choices in a very ordinary life ripple into different endings.

**Emotional pillars:**

1. **Ordinary life as a spiritual trial.** No epic battles, just _answer this message, stay late, feed the cat_ but every choice is secretly existential.
2. **Self-hatred vs self-compassion.** The real boss fight is inside his head.
3. **Karma as feedback, not punishment.** The game never says _good_ or _bad_ just _this is what these choices grow into._
4. **Cat as quiet guide.** Not a talking mascot, but a recurring presence and mirror.

## Structural proposal: daily loop

* The game plays out over **X days** (e.g. 30–60 in-game days).
* Each day has **fixed beats**, but the events inside those beats vary based on your previous choices.

**Daily beats:**

1. **Wake up**

   * Check phone (messages from boss, family, spam).
   * Simple choices: snooze, get up immediately, morning ritual (coffee, stretches, stare into void).
   * Stats shift based on habits: e.g. you can carve out rituals that protect your sanity.

2. **Cat encounter**

   * Neighbor’s cat may or may not appear.
   * You can ignore it, pet it, talk to it, feed it, confess your thoughts to it.
   * This affects a hidden **Openness** and **Cat Affinity** stat.

3. **Commute**

   * Vignettes: crowded train, old lady who needs a seat, someone bumps you, a crying child, street musician, homeless man, etc.
   * Choices:

     * Stay in your head and stew.
     * Act kindly (offer seat, small gestures).
     * Act cold or hostile.
   * These feed into your **Karmic Trajectory** and your internal narrative.

4. **Work**

   * Tasks come in: overtime requests, co-worker screwups, unreasonable boss demands.
   * You are **always competent**, but choice is:

     * Overperform quietly (reinforcing martyrdom).
     * Set boundaries (_I can do that tomorrow_).
     * Passive-aggressive sabotage or harsh responses.
   * **Company never truly rewards you**; your change is internal, or in subtle human relationships.

5. **Evening**

   * Options: go straight home, wander the city, convenience store, tiny ramen place, park, bar, call someone, stay late at work.
   * This is where you can build or reject small human connections:

     * Chat with the convenience store clerk.
     * Talk to a neighbor.
     * Or isolate and doomscroll.

6. **Night / Dream**

   * Short dream vignette that shows a scene from his past life.
   * The content changes based on your Karmic Trajectory.
   * At first they’re symbolic and confusing.
   * Later they become clearer: you see yourself as someone cruel and powerful doing harm.
   * The game **never sermonizes**, it just shows parallels between then and now.

## Core systems

### Stats

* **Self-Hatred** (SH): how harshly he judges himself.
* **Self-Compassion** (SC): ability to treat himself kindly.
* **Isolation** (IS): tendency to withdraw from others.
* **Connection** (CN): quality of genuine connections (cat counts).
* **Resentment** (RS): bitterness at the world / “why me”.
* **Karmic Clarity** (KC): awareness of his past life and what “karma” actually means.

Some of these can be visible (e.g. IS, CN), others hidden (KC, RS) to keep it mystical.

These stats drive:

* Available dialogue options.
* Tone of internal monologue.
* What dream scenes you see.
* Which endings unlock.

### Choice design

The game’s soul is in the choices. Important principles:

* Avoid obvious _good/bad_ labels.
* Choices often look like:

  * Do it perfectly and silently.
  * Do it adequately and go home.
  * Refuse and accept consequences.
  * Do it but complain internally / externally.
* Many choices affect **multiple axes**:

  * Staying late might reduce RS (feels safe: I did my duty) but increase SH and IS.
  * Saying no might spike anxiety now, but increase SC and CN later.

### Karma system

He is _paying karma_ from a past life. Mechanically:

* **Karmic Debt:** a hidden _pool_ representing his past misdeeds.
* Early game: world feels stacked against him (bad luck events, rejection, constant extra work).
* As he makes choices that *acknowledge suffering consciously* (help others, accept consequences without self-pity, show compassion), the game:

  * Slightly reduces Karmic Debt.
  * Makes life *not easier*, but more *meaningful* (different scenes, deeper connections, more honest dialogues).
* If he leans into cruelty, disconnection, and resentment:

  * Karmic Debt increases.
  * Past life dreams show him becoming the monster again.
  * The universe starts echoing that: small scenes where he *becomes* the person who hurt him.

Karma is not a point system that gives loot; it’s a lens that changes the story composition.

## Narrative structure

### Acts

You could structure it in 3 acts:

1. **Act I – Numb Routine**

   * Days are very similar.
   * Player thinks it’s just a _sad sim._
   * Dreams are vague and disturbing but not clearly connected to karma.
   * Cat is just _a cat._

2. **Act II – Cracks in the Shell**

   * New events start appearing: a junior colleague who admires him, an old friend reaching out, an HR evaluation, neighbor trouble, landlord issues.
   * Past life becomes clearer: you see him as a ruthless officer / warlord / corporate sociopath in some other era.
   * Explicit clues of _this is karmic payback_ appear.
   * Player choices begin to diverge the story strongly.

3. **Act III – Confrontation**

   * Big events hit: layoffs, health scare, the cat disappears, neighbor crisis, major office injustice.
   * Here is where your accumulated trajectory matters:

     * Do you collapse?
     * Do you lash out?
     * Do you take radical responsibility and walk away?
   * Final dream sequences show either:

     * Repetition of the past cruelty,
     * Or conscious acceptance and transformation.

## Endings

1. **The Numb Wheel**

   * He keeps the job, stays competent, never confronts anything.
   * Final scenes: same morning, same train, same office.
   * Internal monologue slightly softened if you made some kind choices, but overall: karmic wheel barely moved.
   * Tone: melancholic, not _game over,_ just _you chose not to choose._

2. **The Resentful Descent**

   * He leans heavily into resentment and cruelty: snaps at colleagues, tramples others, becomes emotionally dead.
   * Final dream: he *becomes* his past-life abuser fully.
   * Epilogue shows future life hooks: he’s basically lining himself up for an even harsher incarnation.
   * Needs careful handling, but thematically: _doubling down on your karma._

3. **The Quiet Acceptance**

   * He doesn’t quit. He stays in the same job, same city.
   * But:

     * He sets boundaries.
     * He adopts the neighbor’s cat when something happens to the neighbor.
     * He cultivates a small circle of people he treats with tenderness.
   * Final dream: past life scene where he chooses *not* to take an easy cruel action.
   * The world doesn’t change much, but his *relationship to suffering* does. That’s the win.

4. **The Radical Break**

   * After enough Karmic Clarity & Self-Compassion, he hits a breaking point:

     * He quits (even though it terrifies him).
     * He downsizes or takes a low-status job that gives him more breathing space (barista, caretaker, translator, whatever fits your taste).
   * He sacrifices status and safety but steps out of the karmic pattern of _endure abuse silently._
   * Final dream: past life dissolves; he sees himself across lifetimes and chooses a more conscious, humble path.

5. **The Bodhisattva Loop**

   * Hardest to unlock. Requires:

     * High Self-Compassion.
     * High Connection.
     * High Karmic Clarity.
   * Instead of _escaping suffering,_ he accepts that life will be painful but decides:

     * I'll stay in this world and be kind anyway.
   * Maybe he *doesn’t* leave the job. He uses his position to protect juniors, quietly fights for fairness, mentors others, and keeps feeding the cat.
   * Final dream is non-linear: he sees multiple lives, his own cruelty and his own kindness, and smiles anyway.
   * The message: the point was never to dodge karma, but to carry it differently.

## The Cat

The cat deserves its own section.

* Mechanically:

  * Appears most days in small scenes.
  * You can ignore, pet, feed, monologue to it, or even be cold to it.
* Narrative functions:

  * Safe, nonjudgmental presence.
  * Mirror: its behavior reacts subtly to your internal state — skittish when you’re harsh, relaxed when you’re gentle.
  * Optional big reveal:

    * The cat is connected to someone from the past life (victim or witness).
    * Or the cat is **nothing mystical at all**, and the karmic meaning is that *you chose love anyway.*

You can decide if you want an explicit metaphysical twist or leave it in Schrödinger territory.

## Tone & philosophy

Important: the game shouldn’t feel like a moral lecture or a self-harm fantasy.

* It should **validate** that life can suck unfairly.
* It should **not** glamorize self-destruction.
* It should show that:

  * You can’t control most external events.
  * You *can* choose how you meet them.
  * Karma isn’t _you deserve to be crushed,_ it’s _patterns echo until you meet them differently._
